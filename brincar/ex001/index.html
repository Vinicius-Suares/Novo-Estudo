    <h1>This is my return</h1>
    <p>I'm returning from my studying pause, so I gonna start again and try to be better than before.
        I think that studying 1 time is not enough, so I decided to start studying again.
    </p>
    <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
    <h2>Class 1 </h2>
    <p>In this class we learn about that we dont need to write correct on the document, you can write anyway that you want. This happens because the tag reads whats whitten not the way that Its written, so you can write the way you want in the document and It shows everything in sequence.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p><strong>Look at the document to see</strong>.</p>
    <p>I am writing this
        the way
        that
        i want
        and it shows correct to you.
    </p>
    <p>We learn that you can break a row too, using the tag <br>&lt;br&gt;(breakrow).</p>
    <p>We learn some simbols too, like &lt;(& l t ;) and &gt;(& g t ;).</p>

    <h2>Class 2</h2>
    <p>In this class we learned about emojis and simbols, how to put them in the document. <br>
    You can put some simbols using &SOMESIMBOL;. <br> 
    For emojis we use &#+EMOJICODE;. 
    </p>

    <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
    <h2>Class 1</h2>
    <p>We learned about copyright and where can we get some pictures free of commiting a crime. The websites were: Unsplash and Pexels.</p>
    <h2>Class 2</h2>
    <p>In this class we saw about Gimp and the shape of the pictures like PNG and JPEG.</p>
    <h2>Class 3</h2>
    <p>In class 3 we learned that reducing the size of the images helps the website to be light, like if you put an image with 2000wx1000h it'll weigh the website, so you have too reduce its scale.</p>
    <h2>Class 4</h2>
    <p>In this class we saw how to use the tag &lt;img&gt;(image) that contais 2 addicional things: src(source) and alt(alternative). Src is the source that you want too put in the document, the image.The alt is a text that you write describing the image, this helps people that are blind for example.</p>
    <p>We can use the tag in different ways:</p>
    <h3>In the same foulder:</h3>
    <img src="conteudo/imagens/css-300.png" alt="CSS3 logo">
    <h3>In other foulder:</h3>
    <img src="conteudo/imagens/html-300.png" alt="HTML5 logo">
    <h3>And using it adress:</h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png" alt="JavaScript logo" width="300px">
    <p>You can choose some source in the foulder just pressing CONTROL+SPACE, it'll show the content that you can put in it.</p>
    <h2>Class 5</h2>
    <p>In this class we saw that we can change the favicon. First of all, What is a favicon? Its the little picture that is near the name of the website.</p>
    <p>We can change it using link:favicon in the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; and changing the "href=''" as you put in the image</p>
    <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
    <h2>Class 1</h2>
    <p>In this class we saw that &lt;h1/h2/h3/h4/h5/h6&gt; are an hierarchy, so h1 is the most important the main title.</p>
    <h2>Class 2</h2>
    <p>We saw that semantic is important for the document. Some tags do something in the text but dont have a mean for the document so we change for one that have semantic, to add a meaning for the content.</p>
