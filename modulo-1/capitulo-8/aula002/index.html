    <title>Different Formatting</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>We have many types of formatting, but they have a meaning? Thats why we have tags with and without semantic. Lets see then</h1>
    <h2>Bold / Important</h2>
    <p>We can bold some <b>important</b> thing just using the tag &lt;b&gt;(without semantic)</p>
    <p>We can also bold <strong>something</strong> showing that its important using the tag &lt;strong&gt;(with semantic)</p>
    <h2>Italic / Enphasis</h2>
    <p>We can put <i>some texts</i> in italic using the tag &lt;i&gt;(without semantic)</p>
    <p>Also, we can <em>put it</em> with semantic using the tag &lt;em&gt;</p>
